      <h2 class="h2-title">What is <span class="highlight">Matrescence</span>?</h2>
      <p>There is a word for the changes that one goes through in transitioning to motherhood. That word is
        <em>matrescence</em>. It is the radical identity shift a woman goes through as she becomes a mother. Dr. Aurelie Athan explains that matrescence is just like adolescence. This change manifests biologically, psychologically, socially, emotionally even spiritually and has been likened to the remarkable developments that occur during adolescence. These changes begin with pregnancy and contrary to popular belief, do not come to an end. They go on for as long as a momma is bringing up her children. Unfortunately, we live in a world where this transition is not acknowledged - in many cases, dismissed even. Yet, this phase is a reality for ALL mommas. </p><br>

          <img src="/images/main-matrescence.jpg" alt="">
        
        <p>We are often gracious to adolescents as they navigate the myriad of changes they are going through. In the same breath, mommas need time to navigate these changes, time to figure out the new person they are and grace to realize that life as they knew it, has changed. Mama Kazaliwa is here to let you know that while these may be the most beautiful years of your existence, they will also push you to the limits, and may be some of the most difficult. This ambivalence, the contradiction of something phenomenally beautiful yet incredibly hard, is not in your head, dear momma. </p><br>
       </div>
       <p>We have gone through it, we continue to go through it - we just don't have conversations about it. Understanding Matrescence allows mommas to know that there is nothing inherently wrong with them. Appreciating that motherhood changes us is one of the most profound truths to be encountered. Journeying with Mama Kazaliwa will allow you to explore these changes, see yourself in a different light and extend grace to yourself. </p>

       <h2 class="h2-title">Our Postpartum <span class="highlight">Packages</span></h2>
       <p>It really does take a village to raise a child. The truth is that in today's communities, new mothers often feel isolated - whether it is due to physical distance, strained relationsips or busy lives in a modern world. Add to these the challenges that come with newborn care, such as sleep deprivation, birth trauma and mental health conditions and it is easy to see why mommas need to be support. Our postpartum packages allow Mama Kazaliwa to do just that for you - support mommas at a most vulnerable time of their lives. This includes emotional and practical support as you adjust to motherhood. Get in touch with us today <a href="contact.html"> -link- </a> to schedule a free consult.   </p>

       <h2 class="h2-title">Mama Kazaliwa <span class="highlight">Gatherings</span></h2>
       <div class="mid-div grid">
        <p>Mama Kazaliwa hosts bi-monthly gatherings where we meet physically with members of our community and share on our varied Matresence experiences. In a society where mommas have consistently put everyone else before themselves, these gatherings are a reminder for each one of us that we get to redefine who we are through the Matrescence lens. <br><br>
          That by leaning into our femininity, we are able to rise and be the very best version of mommas that we can be. Once mommas understand what matrescence is, they are able to make sense of the changes they experience and take it in stride.   <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mama_kazaliwa/" target="_blank">Follow us on Instagram to stay updated <i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a>   </p>
